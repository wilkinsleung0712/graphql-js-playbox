# import Link from "./src/generated/prisma.graphql"

# This import syntax used here is not part of the official GraphQL specification (yet!). It comes from the graphql-import package which is being used by graphql-yoga to resolve any dependencies across .graphql files.
# Note that in this case, it wouldn’t actually make a difference if you left the Link type as it was. However, it is a lot more convenient to only define the Link type once and then reuse that definition. Otherwise you’d have to update multiple definitions whenever you’re changing the Link type.
# Great, that’s it! You can finally start the server now and test the API now!
type Query {
  info: String!
  feed: [Link!]!
  # Fetch a single link by its `id`
  link(id:ID!): Link
}

type Mutation {
  post(url: String!, description: String!): Link!
  updateLink(id: ID!, url: String, description: String): Link
  deleteLink(id: ID!): Link
}
